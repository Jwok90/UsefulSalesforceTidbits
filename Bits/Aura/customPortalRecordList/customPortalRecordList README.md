## customPortalRecordList

In Salesforce Experience Sites (formerly Customer Communities), the RecordList standard component has some Mobile use limitations. 
Specifically, changes to the component's Header Properties (such as "Show list actions") to not apply when the component is viewed on a mobile device.

To address this issue, customPortalRecordList provides more fine-tuned control of what a site user views, on both desktop and mobile devices.

The configurable properties of this document are as follows:
* Show Search Box
* Show Actions

* Show Row Level Actions
* Number of Rows
* Available Listviews

* Include "Recently Viewed"
* View All as Default View
